## Development

### Setup steps
Setup is through Github Pages, Jekyll, and Namecheap (for a custom url).

Theme is Garth but a few files are overwritten (default layout, Sass colors).


### Deploys and ongoing dev
[Instructions for using Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

Pushing to main auto-deploys to the custom url.

Run `jekyll serve` and navigate to http://localhost:4000/ for testing changes.
