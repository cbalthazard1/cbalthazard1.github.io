Hello!

My name is Chris Balthazard. I'm a software engineer formerly at Panorama Education for just under five years. I use he/him pronouns, and am based near Boston, MA.

I'm interested in using this space to blog about anything and everything! And if you'd like to work with me, here's [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-balthazard/).
